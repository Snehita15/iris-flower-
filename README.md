# Iris Flower Classification project 
# Introduction

The Iris flower dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics, often used for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. These samples belong to one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. The aim of this project is to build models that can predict the species of an iris flower based on these features.

# Objectives

1.To understand and apply classification algorithms in machine learning.
2.To train and evaluate models for predicting iris flower species.
3.To compare the performance of different algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree.

# Dataset Overview
Source: Built-in iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.
Total Samples: 150
Classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
Features:
Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)

# Methodology
1.Data Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset using load_iris() from sklearn.
Converted the dataset into a DataFrame using pandas for easy manipulation.
Split the data into training and testing sets (80%-20% split).
2.Algorithms Used
a. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A non-parametric method used for classification.
Classifies a sample based on a majority vote of its 'k' nearest neighbors.
b. Decision Tree
A tree-like model of decisions.
Splits the data at each node based on feature values to form decision paths.
3.Evaluation Metrics
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report: Precision, Recall, F1-score

# Results
K-Nearest Neighbors (k=3)
Achieved high accuracy on test data.
Showed perfect classification for Setosa, and minor misclassifications between Versicolor and Virginica.
Decision Tree:
Also performed well.
Slightly more prone to overfitting compared to KNN.
Confusion Matrices and Accuracy Reports
Visual representations were plotted using matplotlib and seaborn to analyze model performance.

# Conclusion
Both KNN and Decision Tree models can effectively classify iris flowers.
KNN is simple and effective, while Decision Trees offer interpretability.
The project provides hands-on experience with supervised learning and classification algorithms.

# Applications
Serves as a foundation for understanding classification problems.
Useful in real-world applications such as image recognition, bioinformatics, and medical diagnostics.

# Future Scope
Try additional algorithms such as SVM or Random Forest.
Apply cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
Deploy the model using a web interface like Streamlit or Flask.
